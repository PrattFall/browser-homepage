# Browser Homepage

Just another browser homepage.

## Usage

First run `npm install` and rename `settings.defualt.json` to `settings.json` to get everything set up. Then add any sites and categories you want to the sites and categories arrays. In order to see changes you will have to run `gulp` from the terminal. At the moment `gulp watch` does not update correctly when the settings.json file is changed.

## Development

Run `gulp` (or `gulp watch` beforehand) to see any changes to the index.html and scss files.
